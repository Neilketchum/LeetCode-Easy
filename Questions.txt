1.String Compression
    https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/
    The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

    values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's 
    descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

4 Verifying an Alien Dictionary
    https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/
    In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. 
    The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.
    Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, 
    return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.
5 Assign Cookies
    https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/
    Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, 
    you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi,
    which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a 
    size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your 
    goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
6 Reverse Only letters  
    https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-only-letters/
    Given a string S, return the "reversed" string where all characters that are not a letter stay in the same place, and 
    all letters reverse their positions.
7 Split a String in Balanced Strings
    https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-in-balanced-strings/
    Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.
    Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.
    Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.
8 Add Strings
    https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/
    Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.
9 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
    https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
    Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
    If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
    Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
10  Last Stone Weight
    https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/
    We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.Each turn, we choose the
    two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:
    If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
    If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
    At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)
11 Range Sum of BST
    https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/
    Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between L and R (inclusive).
    The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.
12  Intersection of Two Linked Lists
    https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/
    Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.    
13  Reverse Vowels of a String
    https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/
    Write a function that takes a string as input and reverse only the vowels of a string.
14 Binnary Tree Paths
    https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/
    Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.
15 Valid Mountain array
    https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-mountain-array/
    Given an array A of integers, return true if and only if it is a valid mountain array.
16 Longest Common Prefix
    https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/submissions/
    Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
    If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
17  Valid Palindrome 2
    https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/
    Given a non-empty string s, you may delete at most one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome
18  Ransom Note
    https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/
    Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, 
    write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines otherwise,
    it will return false.Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.
19  Reverse Strings
    https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/    
20  Valid Anagram
    https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/
    Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.
21  First Unique Character in a String
    https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/
    Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.
